      description: "A comma delimited list of resource properties to sort the results by. Ascending order is assumed for each property. If descending order is desired, the unary negative should prefix the property name. Invalid property values will be ignored. If no sort parameter is passed in a request, the default sort is by fullName. If sorting by relevanceScore, you 1) will likely use -relevanceScore as a higher score indicates a more relevant result and 2) cannot use it in conjunction with other sort properties. Possible fields to sort by are fullName, parkCode, and relevanceScore."
